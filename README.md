## Introduction

I want to contribute to the Gods Unchained community. I hope this tool will help you play.

GC Tracker is a desktop deck tracker application for Gods Unchained. This tool will display all the cards in your deck as well as the drawing odds. You could check code and run this code at your PC. The packaged version can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/passionbull/gc-tracker/releases/tag/v0.9). 



A premium version has also been developed. This version has been upgraded from this free version. It tracks cards played by opponents. Anyone who has trade cards or given a donation on the [godscombine site](https://godscombine.com/about) can download the premium version.
